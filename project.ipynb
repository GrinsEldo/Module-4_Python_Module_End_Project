To approach the tasks outlined for this project with ABC company, we can break it down into specific steps. Below, I'll guide you through the tasks, explaining what to do at each stage to meet the requirements of preprocessing, analysis, and graphical representation.

1. Preprocessing (1 mark)
Task:
Correct the data in the "height" column by replacing it with random numbers between 150 and 180.
Steps:
Check for missing or incorrect values in the "height" column.
Generate random heights between 150 and 180 for any missing or incorrect data points.
Ensure data consistency by verifying that there are no outliers or unreasonable values after this correction.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Assuming `df` is your DataFrame
np.random.seed(42)  # For reproducibility

# Replace 'height' column with random numbers between 150 and 180
df['height'] = np.random.randint(150, 181, size=df.shape[0])

# Check if the changes are applied
print(df['height'].describe())
2. Analysis Tasks
2.1 Distribution of Employees Across Each Team (2 marks)
Steps:
Group the employees by team and calculate the number of employees in each team.
Calculate the percentage distribution of employees across teams.

# Group by team and count the number of employees in each team
team_distribution = df['team'].value_counts()

# Calculate the percentage of total employees in each team
team_percentage = (team_distribution / df.shape[0]) * 100

# Display results
print(team_distribution)
print(team_percentage)
2.2 Segregate Employees Based on Their Positions (2 marks)
Steps:
Group the employees by position and count how many employees hold each position.

# Group by position and count the number of employees in each position
position_distribution = df['position'].value_counts()

# Display results
print(position_distribution)
2.3 Predominant Age Group (2 marks)
Steps:
Create age groups (e.g., 18-30, 31-40, 41-50, etc.).
Find which age group contains the most employees.

# Define age groups
bins = [18, 30, 40, 50, 60, 100]
labels = ['18-30', '31-40', '41-50', '51-60', '60+']

df['age_group'] = pd.cut(df['age'], bins=bins, labels=labels, right=False)

# Group by age group and count the number of employees
age_group_distribution = df['age_group'].value_counts()

# Display results
print(age_group_distribution)
2.4 Team and Position with the Highest Salary Expenditure (2 marks)
Steps:
Group the data by team and position, and then calculate the total salary expenditure.
Identify which team and position have the highest salary total.
# Group by team and position, then sum the salaries
salary_expenditure = df.groupby(['team', 'position'])['salary'].sum()

# Find the team and position with the highest expenditure
highest_expenditure = salary_expenditure.idxmax()
highest_salary = salary_expenditure.max()

print(f"Team and Position with the highest salary expenditure: {highest_expenditure}")
print(f"Total Salary Expenditure: {highest_salary}")
2.5 Correlation Between Age and Salary (2 marks)
Steps:
Calculate the correlation between the age and salary columns.
Create a scatter plot to visualize the correlation.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Calculate correlation
correlation = df['age'].corr(df['salary'])
print(f"Correlation between age and salary: {correlation}")

# Create scatter plot to visualize the correlation
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.scatterplot(x='age', y='salary', data=df)
plt.title("Correlation between Age and Salary")
plt.xlabel("Age")
plt.ylabel("Salary")
plt.show()
3. Graphical Representations (10 marks)
For each of the analysis tasks, you need to create appropriate visualizations:

3.1 Team Distribution (Pie Chart or Bar Plot)

# Pie chart for team distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
team_distribution.plot(kind='pie', autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90, cmap='Set2')
plt.title("Distribution of Employees Across Teams")
plt.ylabel('')
plt.show()
3.2 Position Distribution (Bar Plot)
# Bar plot for position distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
position_distribution.plot(kind='bar', color='skyblue')
plt.title("Employee Distribution by Position")
plt.xlabel("Position")
plt.ylabel("Number of Employees")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
3.3 Age Group Distribution (Bar Plot)
# Bar plot for age group distribution
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
age_group_distribution.plot(kind='bar', color='lightcoral')
plt.title("Predominant Age Group Among Employees")
plt.xlabel("Age Group")
plt.ylabel("Number of Employees")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
3.4 Team and Position with Highest Salary Expenditure (Bar Plot)
# Bar plot to show the highest salary expenditure by team and position
salary_expenditure.sort_values(ascending=False).head(10).plot(kind='bar', figsize=(10, 6), color='lightgreen')
plt.title("Top 10 Teams and Positions by Salary Expenditure")
plt.xlabel("Team and Position")
plt.ylabel("Total Salary Expenditure")
plt.xticks(rotation=90)
plt.show()
3.5 Correlation Between Age and Salary (Scatter Plot)
# Scatter plot for age vs. salary
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.scatterplot(x='age', y='salary', data=df)
plt.title("Age vs. Salary")
plt.xlabel("Age")
plt.ylabel("Salary")
plt.show()
4. Data Story (3 marks)
Insights:
Team Distribution: Most employees are in certain teams, indicating potential high demand in those areas.
Position Distribution: A certain position might be overrepresented, pointing to hierarchical trends.
Age Group: The predominant age group could indicate whether the company is skewed towards younger or older employees.
Salary Expenditure: Certain teams and positions may be associated with higher salary costs, which could reflect their strategic importance or specialization.
Correlation between Age and Salary: If there's a strong positive correlation, it might suggest that employees earn more as they gain experience, or it might indicate that older employees tend to have higher-level roles.
Conclusion:
Complete the tasks systematically, focusing on preprocessing the dataset first before moving on to the analysis and visualizations.
The graphical representations should be clear, with appropriate labels and titles to make the insights easy to understand.
The data story should provide actionable insights for ABC company, helping them understand employee distribution, salary trends, and other important aspects.
